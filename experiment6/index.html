			<h1>Experiment 6</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this Experiment, Nathaniel Valdenor worked with Ashley Knapp and Kevin Gallegos to create a series of scenes with accompanying
					lines, written as a narrative experience. As of right now, it runs as an infinite loop and rolls randomly through different
					grammars that is utilized by Tracery to write with.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Kevin started this Experiment by implementing the scenes into the page using Phaser. He also implemented Tracery into the assignment, 
					and created a base grammar for him to use. Ashley and Nathaniel then added onto the project, with their own grammars. At this point, 
					the project could now use all three of their grammars. Afterwards, Kevin drew and implemented a spritesheet for scene changes and a 
					textbox to put the randomly generated lines in.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In the last Experiment, Ashley and I worked together. This time, however, Kevin was added into the equation, and so this was our first 
					time working with all three of us involved. The work being divided amongst us was easier to handle, but it meant that communication was 
					more necessary to keep things running smoothly. As we exercised more communication, the pieces fit together and we were able to complete 
					the project without any extra stress on our shoulders. I believe we are all proud of what's come out of this Experiment, and if we wanted to, 
					we could polish it and make it more convoluted in terms of implementing a more complete narrative.

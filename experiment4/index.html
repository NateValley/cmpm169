				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this Experiment, Ashley Knapp and Nathaniel Valdenor worked together to create and modify a shader to adjust the color and shape of a cube and a torus.
					Inside the cube is Mario from the hit-game franchise Super Mario Bros., and in the torus is Remy from Disney Pixar's Ratatouille. All of the objects have a floating effect,
					and the 3D objects rotate on their own individual points. If the user clicks, it switches the textures of the cube and the torus.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Ashley started off by creating a water shader and modifying it for a cube, and Nathaniel followed afterwards and modified the same shader and added that to the torus.
					The modifications included base/peak colors, tiling, manipulation speed, and alpha (opacity) value. Each shape has their own color changing functions, as we noticed that
					the settings for the shader don't look the same on each shape.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As our first Experiment working with one another- or with somebody else at all- in this class, we felt that it went very smoothly. Though it may have helped that we were already
					friends who were used to pair programming with each other prior to working on this. Ashley was very excited to work on shaders for the first time, so they had a lot of fun with
					it, and found that this project was a very nice introduction. What helped Ashley the most on this project was playing around with simple vertex and fragment shaders, as well as
					referring to a tutorial and example she found. For Nathaniel, it was also his first time working with shaders, and found that Ashley's initial idea of the experiment was really
					entertaining and would be a good way to also start learning about shaders. Nathaniel was able to pick up where Ashley left off very smoothly, but not in a way that either of them
					didn't do as much as the other in terms of work load. All in all, working with one another was both fun and very efficient.

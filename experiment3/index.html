				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					This Experiment plays Kermit and Rowlf's 'I Hope that Somethin' Better Comes Along', and the song affects both the background and soundwaves.
					The soundwaves' color- and very slightly, opacity- changes depending on the current frequency of the song. The background's dimness is affected
					by the volume of the song at the time. The song itself could be found as controversial, but The Muppets original movie from 1979 is a comfort movie of mine,
					and I grew up on these songs. I found that this song was the most interesting in terms of using it with an audial-visual medium.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					As previously mentioned, the soundwaves' color is affected by the frequencies. The lower frequencies adjust the color to lean towards the brown shade that Rowlf is,
					while the higher frequencies are reserved for a Kermit shade of green. In the medium frequencies, the colors mix. For the opacity of the background, I simply added a
					black rectangle, and adjusted its opacity using the volume of the song. As you can see, I adjusted the waves so that they are smoother and don't peak too high, as I wanted
					the image to still be visible even with the waves reacting a lot. I also have the song looped using the loop() function from the p5.js sound library.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In this Experiment, I simply just wanted to see how it felt to work with an audio visualizer, as I've never
					had the chance to do that before. I definitely could have spent more time on this, but recently I've had higher priorities,
					so I understand that this could have been more polished had I had the time. Despite that, I can appreciate the way that I was
					able to utilize the p5.js sound library in particular for this project, and I feel comfortable incorporating more of it in the
					near future, possibly on the next Experiment.

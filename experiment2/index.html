				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, I am trying to simulate the way that creatures with different behaviors would thrive depending on randomly generated environments.
					I wanted to see which behavior would cause a type of Mem to thrive against the others.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Each creature- a Mem- runs on a state machine, that keeps track of certain conditions that will affect the way the Mem acts. The different colors of Mems are their "types", and I had each type of Mem behave differently.
					Currently, when a Mem has the resources, they build a structure- called a Site- that belongs to that Mem's type.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In terms of successes, I'm happy to say that so far, I have gotten the Mems to complete a cycle of exploration before they stop.
					I struggled with this experiment due to the scope of this project, and I plan on continuing and adapting this project for Experiment 3,
					 as that assignment will be focused on random generation. Reflecting back on the work I've done, I'm happy to have what I have, though I
					wish that I had considered the state machine structure sooner rather than later, because that definitely set me back.
